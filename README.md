## Get Started Immediately

To get started, you can either watch the [livestream where we create an
ecommerce from zero to production explaining all the steps][26] or follow the
instructions below 👇.

Use the [Crystallize CLI][17] to bootstrap a project in 4 simple guied steps.

Simply run the following command (>= Node 8 required):

```sh
npx @crystallize/cli my-project
```

**This will walk you through the steps:**

1. Choose the tech stack you want

   > To get this storefront, select: Next.js - Complete ecommerce

2. Specify your tenant (the name of your project)

   > At this point, you can select our demo tenant (furniture) or use your own.
   > If you choose your own, you will have to create the content on our [Product
   > Information Management][9]

3. Select if you want to support multiple languages

4. Select the service API
   > At this point, you can select between our demo Service API or your own
   > service API tenant.
   >
   > A [Service API is an open-source project that acts as backend for any of
   > our open-source storefronts][25] that currently hndles the basket, the
   > checkout, the authentication, webhooks, etc. You can modify and/or extended
   > it as you like. Deploy it to Vercel, Amazon Web Services, etc. (we're
   > adding new provieders)
   >
   > Take into account that if you've selected your own tenant, you need to have
   > your own service API because our demo Service API doesn't support products
   > with different shape/attributes.
   >
   > To have your own Service API, you'll need to execute again, our CLI and
   > select the option "Service API - Backend for any of the frontends"

Once your project has been created, you can simply navigate into your project's
directory and run the following to start up your development server:

```sh
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This will start up the server on http://localhost:3000 for development.
