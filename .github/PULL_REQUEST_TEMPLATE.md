Thanks for your pull request! We love contributions.

However, this repository is what we call a "subtree split": a read-only copy of one directory of the main repository. It enables developers to depend on specific repository.

If you want to contribute, you should instead open a pull request on the main repository:

Thank you for your contribution!

PS: if you haven't already, please add tests.
